# HPC Reloaded
A mocked single-page-application for HPC job submission, using React, Flask and MongoDB. Styled with React-Bootstrap, deployed with Docker Compose.


### Setup

```
docker-compose up
```

Otherwise you can run each layer separately, for instance:

cd frontend
npm start
```

and

```
cd server

```

for the frontend and the backend respectively.
